One of the key challenges in creating video applications is in delivering a great playback experience to the user through a video player. If you're thinking about building video into your application, the Kaltura Player provides the framework and tools to help you easily embed the Video Player into your web or mobile applications. The Player is fully native and offers excellent performance, ensuring that your users receive the best viewing experience. 

The Player's architecture is designed to allow an easy and seamless integration experience with just a few lines of code, enabling you to connect multiple playback engines and platforms. The Kaltura Video Player wraps the playback engine with the same interface and events, thereby allowing the same plugin code to work across multiple platforms. The Kaltura Video Player’s technology determines the best streaming delivery method and DRM as needed. 

The Kaltura Player eliminates all of the headache around implementing video, giving you the time to focus on everything else involved in creating your application.
