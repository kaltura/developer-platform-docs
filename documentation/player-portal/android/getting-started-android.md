# Kaltura Player SDK 3.0 (Android) 

This guide will walk you through the steps for adding a Kaltura video player to your Android mobile application. You'll learn how to import the SDK, find the necessary credentials, and load the player with your Entry ID of choice. **Because the player is focused on performance and giving you the simplest integration possible, it does not contain a UI.** That being said, this guide will show you how to listen to events in order to manage the player state, as well as examples for adding play/pause buttons and a slider to the player. 
Lastly, this guide will cover how to add plugins to the application, specifically the Kaltura Video Analytics plugin.
