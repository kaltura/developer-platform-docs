Kaltura has a rich [captioning Experience](https://knowledge.kaltura.com/help/using-subtitles-and-captions) that is available in the [KMC](https://kmc.kaltura.com/index.php/kmcng/login) 

However, you also are able to embed the caption editor as a standalone component as shown below:

See this [github project](https://github.com/kaltura-vpaas/embeddable-captions-editor) for an in depth guide to embedding the Kaltura caption editor into your web application.
